# TypeReader
An app that can open a pdf and read it to you from your pocket whilst you are going for a walk.

There are good apps like Speechify, NaturalReader, etc. that already do this. I have created this out of interest in the speech synthesis, media player command center, and PDFKit APIs. It has also been an excersize in optimizing ways of working together with LLMs.
