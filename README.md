# TypeReader
An app that can open a PDF and read it from your pocket while you go for a walk.

Good apps like Speechify, NaturalReader, etc., already do this. I created this out of interest in the speech synthesis, media player command center, and PDFKit APIs. It has also been an exercise in optimizing ways of working together with LLMs.
